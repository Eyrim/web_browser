Technical ideas:


Front end ideas:


Feature ideas:
  - A 'collections' feature (like in Edge)
  - A feature to limit usage of different resources (like in Opera Gx)
  - Some password manager built in? (Massive security implications)
  - A *good* history manager (not buried in UI)
  - An incognito mode which actually hides your traffic from other people on your network (E2E?)
